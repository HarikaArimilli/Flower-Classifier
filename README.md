# Flower-Classifier
For,classifying images convolutional neural networks are powerful.But,training them from scratch requires lot of training data.Therefore,we used technique called transfer learning to classify flower images.In this technique,a pretrained(vgg19) technique is used to extract features and train a new layer on top for our own task of classifying images of flowers.
